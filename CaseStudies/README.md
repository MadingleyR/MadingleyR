# MadingleyR example case studies 

We selected three case studies to showcase the ```MadingleyR``` package. The first case study demonstrates how ```MadingleyR``` can be used to assess the role of functional groups in ecosystems by removing herbivores >100 kg, following a similar procedure developed for large carnivores by Hoeks et al. (2020). In the second case study, we illustrate how the model parameters can be changed to reduce the amount of autotroph biomass available for herbivores and omnivores, mimicking the effect of land-use change on heterotrophs (Newbold et al., 2020). In the last case study, we simulate the reduction in autotroph biomass at a large spatial scale (for the continent of Africa) and observed how it impacts the biomass of herbivores spatially.
