# Case studies

### Case study 1

To investigate the role of large and megaherbivores in the Serengeti, we removed endothermic herbivores with a body mass >100 kg from the simulation. This was done by first initialising and running the model for 100-year period (model spin-up) using the default cohort definitions, stock definitions, spatio-temporal input layers and model parameters:

```R
library(MadingleyR)
setwd('C:/MadingleyOut') # create this directory if it does not exist

# Set model params
spatial_window = c(31, 35, -5, -1) # region of interest: Serengeti
sptl_inp = madingley_inputs('spatial inputs') # load default inputs

# set the maximum body masses of the functional groups manually
sptl_inp$Endo_O_max[ ] = 2e+05 # set max size omnivores = 200 kg
sptl_inp$Endo_C_max[ ] = 6e+05 # set max size carnivores = 600 kg
sptl_inp$Ecto_max[ ] = 1.5e+05 # set max size ectotherms = 150 kg

# Initialize model
mdata = madingley_init(spatial_window = spatial_window, spatial_inputs = sptl_inp)

# Run spin-up of 100 years (output results to C:/MadingleyOut)
mdata2 = madingley_run(out_dir = 'C:/MadingleyOut', 
                       madingley_data = mdata, 
                       spatial_inputs = sptl_inp, 
                       years = 100)
```

From the resulting MadingleyR object (```mdata2```) we remove all endothermic herbivore cohorts with a body mass of >100 kg. The modified object was then used to run a consecutive simulation of 50 years. For the control simulation, the same principle was applied, but without any modification to the object created by the model spin-up. Food-web results were plotted for means of comparison between the control and removal simulation:

```R
# Run 50-year control simulation (for later comparison)
mdata3 = madingley_run(madingley_data = mdata2, years = 50, spatial_inputs = sptl_inp)

# Remove large (>100 kg) endothermic herbivores from mdata$cohorts
remove_idx = which(mdata2$cohorts$AdultMass > 1e+5 & mdata2$cohorts$FunctionalGroupIndex == 0)
mdata2$cohorts = mdata2$cohorts[-remove_idx, ]

# Run large herbivore removal simulation (for 50 years)
mdata4 = madingley_run(madingley_data = mdata2, years = 50, spatial_inputs = sptl_inp) 

# Make plots
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot_foodweb(mdata3, max_flows = 5) # control food-web plot
plot_foodweb(mdata4, max_flows = 5) # large-herbivore removal food-web plot
```

### Case study 2

In the second example, we reduced the relative biomass of autotrophs (i.e., vegetation) accessible for herbivory and observed how it affected the biomass of endotherms. First a 100-year spin-up simulation was run using the default MadingleyR input parameters (as described for case study 1).

```R
library(MadingleyR)
setwd('C:/MadingleyOut') # create this directory if it does not exist

# Set model params
spatial_window = c(31, 35, -5, -1) # region of interest: Serengeti
sptl_inp = madingley_inputs('spatial inputs') # load default inputs

# Initialize model
mdata = madingley_init(spatial_window = spatial_window, spatial_inputs = sptl_inp)

# Run spin-up of 100 years (output results to C:/MadingleyOut)
mdata2 = madingley_run(out_dir = 'C:/MadingleyOut', 
                       madingley_data = mdata, 
                       spatial_inputs = sptl_inp, 
                       years = 100)
```
This spin-up simulation was then extended by an additional 5 years without any reduction in available autotroph biomass and the end state was used as the control. The 100-year spin-up was then also used to run 8 independent land-use intensity experiments where the fraction accessible stock mass for herbivory was reduced by 0.1 increments to test the effects over a gradient of land-use intensities. This was done by modifying the default model input parameters (overview of all default parameters is shown in Supporting Information Appendix S4 and S5). Each land-use intensity experiment was run for 5 years and with 10 replicas. The end state of each land-use intensity scenario was compared to the control run.

```R

# Set scenario parameters
reps = 10 # set number of replicas per land-use intensity
avail_bio = sort(rep(seq(1.0, 0.2, -0.1), reps), decreasing = T) # accessible biomass
m_params = madingley_inputs('model parameters') # load default model parameters
fg = c('Herbivore', 'Carnivore', 'Omnivore') # vector for aggregating cohorts
stats = data.frame() # used to store individual model output statistics

# Loop over land-use intensities
for(i in 1:length(avail_bio)) {
 m_params[28, 2] = avail_bio[i] # accessible biomass (see model parameters)
 
 cohorts = madingley_run(
  years = 5, 
  madingley_data = mdata2, 
  model_parameters = m_params, 
  spatial_inputs = sptl_inp)$cohorts # store cohort results only
 
 # Calculate cohort biomass
 cohorts$Biomass = cohorts$CohortAbundance * cohorts$IndividualBodyMass 
 cohorts = cohorts[cohorts$FunctionalGroupIndex<3, ] # only keep endotherms
 cohorts = aggregate(cohorts$Biomass, by = list(fg[cohorts$FunctionalGroupIndex + 1]), sum)
 stats = rbind(stats, cohorts) # attach aggregated stats
}

# Calculate mean relative (to control) response per replica simulation
stats$veg_reduced = sort(rep(1 - avail_bio, 3))
m = aggregate(stats$x, by = list(stats$veg_reduced, stats$Group.1), FUN = mean)
m$x_rel = NA;
for(i in fg) { 
 m$x_rel[m$Group.2 == i] = m$x[m$Group.2 == i]/m$x[m$Group.2 == i][1] 
}

# Make final plots
plot(1 - unique(red_avail_bio), m$x_rel[m$Group.2 == 'Herbivore'], 
     col= 'green', pch = 19, ylim = c(0, 1.5), xlim = c(0, 1),
     xlab = 'Relative vegetation biomass inaccessible', ylab = 'Relative change in cohort biomass')
points(1 - unique(red_avail_bio), m$x_rel[m$Group.2 =='Carnivore'], col= 'red', pch = 19)
points(1 - unique(red_avail_bio), m$x_rel[m$Group.2 == 'Omnivore'], col = 'blue', pch = 19)
abline(1, -1, lty = 2)
legend(0.0, 0.2, fg, col=c('green', 'red', 'blue'), pch = 19, box.lwd = 0)

<em>Relative change in biomass of endotherm cohorts compared to the control simulation (biomass experiment/biomass control) plotted against the proportion of plant biomass made inaccessible to herbivores and omnivores. A relative change in biomass of 1 indicates no change. Data points represent the relative change in biomass of endothermic carnivores (red), omnivores (blue) and herbivores (green) averaged over 10 replicas extracted at the end of the 5-year simulation experiment. The dashed line indicates the impact expected if the biomass of endotherms decreased linearly with the amount of plant made inaccessible for feeding (i.e. y = âˆ’x).</em>
