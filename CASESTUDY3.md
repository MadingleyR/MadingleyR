<em>Relative change in biomass of endotherm cohorts compared to the control simulation (biomass experiment/biomass control) plotted against the proportion of plant biomass made inaccessible to herbivores and omnivores. A relative change in biomass of 1 indicates no change. Data points represent the relative change in biomass of endothermic carnivores (red), omnivores (blue) and herbivores (green) averaged over 10 replicas extracted at the end of the 5-year simulation experiment. The dashed line indicates the impact expected if the biomass of endotherms decreased linearly with the amount of plant made inaccessible for feeding (i.e. y = âˆ’x).</em>
